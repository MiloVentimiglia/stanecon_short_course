The main reason to learn\nStan is to fit models that are difficult to fit using other software. Such models might include\nmodels with high-dimensional random effects (about which we want to draw inference), models \nwith complex or multi-stage likelihoods, or models with latent data structures. A second reason\nto learn Stan is that you want to conduct Bayesian analysis on workhorse models; perhaps you have\ngood prior information, or are attracted to the possibility of making probabilistic statements about\npredictions and parameter estimates. \n\nWhile this second reason is worthwhile, it is not the aim of this course. This course introduces \na few workhorse models in order to give you the skills to build richer models that extract the most\ninformation from your data. There are three sessions: \n\n1. An introduction to Modern Statistical Workflow, using an instrumental variables model as the example. We will also touch on Simultaneous Equations Modeling. \n2. Hierarchical models and hierarchical priors, of which we can consider panel data a special case. We'll cover fixed and random effects, post-stratification, and the Gelman-Bafumi correction.\n3. An introduction to time-series models, including time-varying parameters, latent factor models, and structural VARs. \n\nThese notes have a few idiosyncracies: \n\n> Tricks and shortcuts will look like this\n\nThe code examples live in the `models/` folder of the book's repository, (https://github.com/khakieconomics/shortcourse/models). \n\nWe use two computing languages in these notes. The first is Stan, a powerful modeling language\nthat allows us to express and estimate probabilistic models with continuous parameter spaces. \nStan programs are prefaced with their location in the `models/` folder, like so:\n\n```\n// models/model_1.stan\n// ...  model code here\n```\n\nWe also use the `R` language, for data preparation, calling Stan models, and visualising model\nresults. R programs live in the `scripts/` folder; they typically read data from the `data/` folder, \nand liberally use `magrittr` syntax with `dplyr`. If this syntax is unfamiliar to you, it is worth\ntaking a look at the [excellent vignette](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/introduction.html)\nto the `dplyr` package. Like the Stan models, all R code in the book is prefaced with its location\nin the book's directory. \n\n```{r}\n# scripts/intro.R\n# ... data work here\n```\n\nIt is not necessary to be an R aficionado to make the most of these notes. Stan programs can be called from within\nStata, Matlab, Mathematica, Julia and Python. If you are more comfortable using those languages than R for data\npreparation work, then you should be able to implement all the models in this book using those interfaces. Further\ndocumentation on calling Stan from other environments is available at [http://mc-stan.org/interfaces/](http://mc-stan.org/interfaces/).\n\nWhile Stan can be called quite easily from these other programming environments, the R implementation is more \nfully-fleshed---especially for model checking and post-processing. For this reason we use the R implementation\nof Stan, `rstan` in this book.\n\n## The structure {-}\n\nAn important premise in these is that we should only build richer, more complex models\nwhen simple ones will not do. After explaining the necessary preliminary concepts, \nEach session is set up around this theme. \n\nThe first session offers an introduction to Stan, walking you through the steps of building,\nestimating, and checking a probability model. We call this procedure _Modern Statistical Workflow_, and\nrecommend it be followed for essentially all modeling tasks. If you're an experienced modeler \nand understand the preliminaries already, this is a good place to start. \n\nThe second session covers hierarchical modeling. The central notion in hierarchical modeling\nis that our data has some hierarchy. Some examples might illustrate the idea: \n\n- Our observations are noisy measures of some true value, about which we want to infer. \n- We have multiple observations from many administrative units, for example students within a school within a region. \n- We observe many individuals over time (panel data). \n\nThere is a large cultural difference between panel/hierarchical data as used by econometricians and \nas used by Bayesian statisticians. We'll take a more statistical approach in this book. The big \ndifference is that Bayesian statisticians think that the primary goal of using hierarchical data \nis to fit a model _at the level of the individual_, but recognising that information from other \nindividuals might be useful in estimating that model. It's a crass simplification, but economists\ntend to view the goal of using panel data as helping to estimate an unbiased or less biased treatment\neffect that abstracts from unobserved information fixed within the individual. These are different goals, \nand we will discuss them later.  \n\nWe will cover fixed and random effects, and the Gelman-Bafumi correction (which makes random effects models\nmore widely applicable). We also discuss how to incorporate instruments in these models. \n\nThe last session introduces some fun time-series models. Chapter seven illustrates how to implement more \nadvanced multivariate time-series models. These include Structural Vector Autoregressions (SVAR), factor models, and state-space methods, including time-varying parameter regressions, and low-to-high frequency missing values interpolation. \n\n### A note on data\n\nThrough this short course, we will not use any real data, but rather force you to simulate fake data where \nthe \"unknowns are known\". This is very good practice, both from the perspective of model checking, but also \nhelping you to understand the underlying data generating process that you are trying to model. \n",
